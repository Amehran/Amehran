I bridge the gap between **Enterprise Mobile Architecture** and **Modern On-Device AI**. With over 10 years of experience, I build systems that are not only intelligent but also secure, scalable, and offline-capable.

> **SDK Development**: For a deep dive into my production-ready SDK work, see my [Android SDKs & Libraries](/android-sdks/) page, featuring the **BarcodeScannerSDK** with 90%+ test coverage, Clean Architecture, and comprehensive CI/CD.

## 📱 Mobile Architecture & Intelligence

I specialize in building robust mobile applications that integrate seamlessly with modern AI backends.

### Project: AI Dev Companion (Android Client)

The native mobile interface for the AI Dev Companion system, demonstrating best-in-class Android engineering to interact with a serverless agent swarm.

*   **Tech Stack:** **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Material Design 3**.
*   **Features:** Real-time streaming responses, syntax highlighting, and secure authentication.
*   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture (MVVM/MVI) ensuring scalability and testability.

## 👁️ Assistive Vision & Edge AI

I develop assistive technology for the visually impaired, leveraging the power of on-device machine learning to provide real-time understanding of the world.

### Focus Areas

*   **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizing **TensorFlow Lite** and **CameraX** to detect obstacles and objects in real-time.
*   **EdgeGen - Zero Latency AI:** Prioritizing user privacy by processing sensitive queries strictly on-device using **Google Gemini Nano** and **MediaPipe**.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Focusing on model quantization and efficient inference to ensure low latency and battery efficiency on mobile devices.
