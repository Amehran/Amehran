## Beyond Chatbots
I build systems that **do**, not just *say*. Using **LangGraph**, I architect state machines where LLMs can loop, retry, and call tools.

### Project: Hierarchical Project Planner
An autonomous system that takes a vague goal ("Launch a new marketing campaign") and recursively breaks it down into actionable Jira tickets.
* **Planner Agent:** Decomposes the goal into phases.
* **Executor Agents:** Research market trends, draft copy, and estimate timelines.
* **Critic Agent:** Reviews the plan for feasibility before final output.
