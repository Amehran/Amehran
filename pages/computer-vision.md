## 👁️ Assistive Vision Technology

I develop assistive technology for the visually impaired, leveraging the power of on-device machine learning to provide real-time understanding of the world.

### Focus Areas

*   **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizing **TensorFlow Lite** and **CameraX** to detect obstacles and objects in real-time.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Focusing on model quantization and efficient inference to ensure low latency and battery efficiency on mobile devices.
*   **Accessibility:** Translating visual data into auditory or haptic feedback to assist users in navigation.
