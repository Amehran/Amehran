I bridge the gap between **Enterprise Mobile Architecture** and **Modern On-Device AI**. With over 10 years of experience, I build systems that are not only intelligent but also secure, scalable, and offline-capable.

## 📱 Mobile Architecture & Intelligence

I specialize in building robust mobile applications that integrate seamlessly with modern AI backends.
