I bridge the gap between **Enterprise Mobile Architecture** and **Modern On-Device AI**. With over 10 years of experience, I build systems that are not only intelligent but also secure, scalable, and offline-capable.

## 📱 Privacy-First Edge Intelligence
Cloud latency and privacy concerns are the bottlenecks of modern AI. I specialize in **Edge Execution**—running Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision models directly on the Android device.

### Project Spotlight: "EdgeGen" (Offline Chat Architecture)
* **The Challenge:** Building a generative chat experience with **zero data egress** and **100% offline availability**.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a local inference pipeline using **Google Gemini Nano** and **MediaPipe**.
* **Result:** Eliminated cloud costs and latency while guaranteeing user privacy.
* **Tech:** Kotlin, Gemini Nano, MediaPipe, Coroutines.

### Project Spotlight: Assistive Vision Pipeline
* **The Challenge:** Real-time obstacle detection for visually impaired users where battery life is critical.
* **The Solution:** Optimized a **TensorFlow Lite** model with **CameraX**, focusing on quantization to reduce thermal impact.
* **Tech:** TFLite (Int8 Quantization), CameraX, Android Neural Networks API (NNAPI).

## 🏛 Enterprise-Grade Android Engineering
Before pivoting to AI, I spent years modernizing critical infrastructure for Tier-1 Financial Institutions. I don't just prototype; I build production-ready software that meets strict compliance standards (OSFI).

### Legacy Modernization & Architecture
* **Migration Expert:** Proven track record re-architecting legacy Java monoliths into modern **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** modules.
* **Performance:** Experience reducing code size by 55% and optimizing build times for large-scale banking apps.
* **Reliability:** Enforcing **Clean Architecture (MVVM/MVI)** and strict **CI/CD** pipelines (GitHub Actions) to ensure zero critical bugs in production releases.
