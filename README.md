## 👨‍💻 Professional Summary

I am a **Principal Machine Learning Engineer** with **10+ years of experience** architecting scalable AI systems. I specialize in solving the "last mile" problem in AI deployment—bridging the gap between **Agentic Workflows** (LangGraph, CrewAI) and **Privacy-First On-Device Inference** (Gemini Nano).

My expertise lies in building privacy-first systems where **Cloud Agents** communicate securely with **Edge Execution**, reducing cloud costs and latency while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards (FinTech/Banking).

## 🔭 Featured Projects

### 🤖 [Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration](https://arminmehran.com/agentic-ai/)
An advanced serverless Python backend engineered using **LangGraph** to coordinate multiple specialized agents. Unlike standard chatbots, this system maintains long-term context, manages state, and executes multi-step reasoning tasks autonomously.

### 📱 [EdgeGen - Privacy-First Hybrid Inference](https://arminmehran.com/edge-vision/)
A hybrid AI architecture designed to prioritize user privacy. The system processes sensitive queries strictly on-device using **Google Gemini Nano** and **MediaPipe**, intelligently routing only complex, non-sensitive tasks to the cloud.
