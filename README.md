Hi there, I'm Armin 👋

Senior Mobile AI Engineer | Agentic AI & On-Device Inference Specialist

I am a Toronto-based Principal Engineer with 10+ years of experience bridging the gap between mobile architecture and modern AI. I specialize in building privacy-first systems where Cloud Agents (Python/CrewAI) communicate securely with Edge Execution (Android/Gemini Nano).

🚀 What I'm Working On

🤖 Agentic Orchestration: Building serverless multi-agent backends using FastAPI and CrewAI that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks.

📱 Edge GenAI: Optimizing Gemini Nano and MediaPipe to run Large Language Models purely on-device (Android), ensuring 100% privacy and offline capability.

👁️ Computer Vision: Developing assistive technology for the visually impaired using TensorFlow Lite and CameraX.
