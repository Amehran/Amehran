<h2>From Mobile Architecture to Intelligent Agents</h2>
<p>
  With over 10 years of experience in software architecture and a PhD in Computer Engineering, I specialize in building scalable, production-grade AI systems.
</p>
<p>
  While my roots are in enterprise mobile development (building apps for millions of users in FinTech), my focus has evolved to Agentic AI. I don't just train models; I build the complex engineering infrastructure required to deploy them—orchestrating multi-agent workflows in the cloud and optimizing inference on the edge.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently focused on solving the "last mile" problem in AI: making autonomous agents fast, reliable, and privacy-compliant on consumer devices.

  <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Engineering Beyond the Code</h3>
  
  <p>
    My approach to problem-solving extends into the physical world. 
    I am an avid woodworker, a discipline that I treat as <strong>tangible system architecture</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Woodworking requires the same rigorous planning, critical thinking, and tolerance for constraints 
    as high-performance software. It forces me to solve complex structural problems without an "Undo" button. 
    Whether I am refactoring a legacy codebase or milling lumber for a custom joinery project, 
    the mindset is identical: <strong>measure twice, execute with precision, and build for longevity.</strong>
